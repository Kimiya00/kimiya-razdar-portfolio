# Kimiya Razdar - Professional Portfolio

A modern, responsive portfolio showcasing my journey from Neuroscience to tech innovation. Clean code meets professional design to demonstrate real-world skills and measurable results.

## What It Does

Professional portfolio featuring interactive hero section with typing animation, skills visualization with animated progress bars, project showcase with hover effects, and responsive contact form. Built with performance and accessibility in mind, showcasing 4+ years of IT experience and growing development skills.

## Why I Built This

Needed a platform that would demonstrate my unique background, combining Neuroscience education with hands-on IT experience and growing development skills. Rather than overselling my coding experience, I wanted to showcase my proven track record of delivering results (30% client growth, 99% system uptime) while highlighting my learning trajectory in web development.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup with accessibility best practices
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with animations, Grid, Flexbox, and glassmorphism effects
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Interactive features, smooth animations, and form handling
- **Modular Architecture** - Organized file structure for maintainability

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kimiya00/kimiya-razdar-portfolio
cd kimiya-razdar-portfolio
open index.html
```

No build process, no dependencies. Clean, organized code structure ready for deployment.

## Key Features

**Professional Positioning:**
- Honest representation of skills with proven results (30% client growth, 99% uptime)
- Clear progression from IT support to development
- Emphasis on problem-solving and measurable impact
- Real certifications and educational background

**Modern Design Elements:**
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Animated typing hero section with rotating titles
- Interactive skill progress bars with smooth animations

- Performance-optimized animations and interactions
- Accessibility features including keyboard navigation
- Professional contact form with validation
- Smooth scrolling navigation with active state tracking

## Design Philosophy

**Honesty over hype:** Rather than claiming senior-level expertise, I showcase real experience (4+ years IT support, measurable business results) while positioning myself as someone with strong fundamentals who's actively growing development skills.

**Results-focused:** Every section includes specific metrics; 30% increase in client inquiries, 20% digital engagement growth, 99% system uptime. This demonstrates I understand business impact, not just technical concepts.

**Professional presentation:** Clean, modern aesthetic that looks like something a real company would use, not a tutorial project.

## Challenges I Solved

**Positioning as a strong candidate without overselling:** How do you stand out as someone changing careers into development?
- Emphasized transferable skills from IT support and digital strategy work
- Highlighted real business results and problem-solving experience
- Used honest skill levels with progress indicators rather than claiming expertise

**Mobile-first responsive design:** Complex layouts with glassmorphism effects breaking down on smaller screens
- Started with mobile wireframes, enhanced for desktop
- Used CSS Grid and Flexbox strategically for flexible layouts
- Maintained visual impact while ensuring usability across all devices

**Performance vs visual appeal:** Wanted modern effects without sacrificing load times
- CSS-only animations instead of heavy JavaScript libraries
- Optimized backdrop-filter usage for glassmorphism
- Throttled scroll events and intersection observers for smooth performance

**Professional credibility:** Balancing learning journey with proven competence
- Led with concrete achievements from current roles
- Positioned development skills as natural evolution of existing tech background
- Used real certifications and education to establish credibility

## What I Learned

This project reinforced that good positioning is as important as technical skills. Instead of trying to appear more experienced than I am, focusing on my actual strengths - IT troubleshooting, digital strategy, data analysis - while showing how these translate to development work.

The technical side taught me advanced CSS techniques like backdrop-filter, creating smooth animations without performance penalties, and building truly responsive layouts that work across all devices.

Most importantly, I learned that employers want to see problem-solving ability and business impact, not just code. Showcasing real results (30% client growth) is more valuable than claiming to know every framework.

## Real-World Applications

**Demonstrated Skills:**
- 4+ years managing technical systems and client relationships
- Proven ability to increase business metrics through digital solutions
- Research background showing analytical thinking and attention to detail
- Multiple certifications in relevant technologies
- Experience with modern deployment platforms like Vercel

**Business Value:**
- Experience managing 100+ issues monthly with 99% uptime
- Track record of growing client engagement and inquiries
- Understanding of both technical implementation and business outcomes
- Multilingual capabilities (English, Persian, Spanish)
